v1.0

This is the official release. Includes the new one way map randomizer, logic to keep dead end maps from having their own entrance within themselves, and a cheat sheet.

Coming soon:

Region exit points behind demon doors can be active constantly (toggleable)
Doors that aren't always targetable can be targetable constantly, eg. Bowerstone Manor, Tavern Cellar, Bordello, etc. (toggleable) 
A more readable, explicit cheat sheet.
